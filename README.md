Overview
---------
CatLog is a free and open-source log reader for Android.  

It shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "Logcat" system log, 
hence the goofy name.  It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via email, 
and filter using a variety of criteria.

Download
--------------

CatLog may be downloaded from [the Google Play Store][3].  

You can also find a direct APK download link from [the CatLog page on nolanlawson' web site][5].
